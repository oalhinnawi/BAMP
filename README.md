# BAMP
Benevolent AstroTurfing Mitigation Project - A deep learning project intended to help stop misinformation and false influence in social media.


Introduction


This projects primary goal is to detect bots and/or false grassroots entities on social media platforms. Current development for BAMP is underway.


Motivation

During the 2016 election an online phenomenon was witnessed, it was suspected that a sizeable foreign influence theorized to originate from Russia had been the definitive factor in an attempted indoctrination attempt. Since the elections passing, mainstream social media (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit) has seen a massive flood of “fake” users who have since impacted these domains in indoctrinating true grassroots supporters of many beliefs (AKA astroturfing). These users do not necessarily originate from foreign locations, in fact, a plurality of them come from internal locations. The aim of BAMP is to mitigate the damage caused by false agents.
